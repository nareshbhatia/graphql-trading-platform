## Scaling Subscriptions Using Redis

By default, we use the standard `PubSub` implementation from
[graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions).
This implementation does not scale well as described in the docs:

> Note that the default PubSub implementation is intended for demo purposes. It
> only works if you have a single instance of your server and doesn't scale
> beyond a couple of connections. For production usage you'll want to use one of
> the PubSub implementations backed by an external store. (e.g. Redis)

We can use
[graphql-redis-subscriptions](https://github.com/davidyaha/graphql-redis-subscriptions)
for a more scalable implementation of `PubSub`. To do this, follow the steps
below:

1. Install and start a Redis server. Here's
   [an article](https://1upnote.me/post/2018/06/install-config-redis-on-mac-homebrew/)
   that describes how to install Redis on MacOS.
2. Open `src/graphql/pubsub.ts`. Comment out the default pubsub implementation
   (lines 2-3). Uncomment the Redis implementation (lines 7-8).
3. Restart the server.

Now Subscriptions will use the Redis server for publish/subscribe.
